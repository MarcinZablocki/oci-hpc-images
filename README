# Introduction

This repository contains templates for generating HPC images compatible with Oracle Cloud cluster networks and compute clusters. 
They are highly customizable, providing abiility to add and remove components. 

# Building image using packer

# Customization

Customization of the image is controlled by two packer variables *build_options* and *build_groups* 

build_options
: Defines features to be enabled in the image
: `default = "noselinux,nomitigations,upgrade,openmpi,nvidia,enroot,monitoring,benchmarks,networkdevicenames"`

| Parameter | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| noselinux | Disabled SELINUX on Enterprise Linux distributions |
| nomitigations | Disables Spectre/Meltdown mitigation via GRUB command line |
| upgrade | Ensure upgrade of all packages from the base image |
| openmpi | Install OpenMPI. Version defined by the build_group openmpi_xxx |
| nvidia | Install NVidia drivers defined by the build_group nvidia_xxx |
| enroot | Install enroot container runtime |
| monitoring | Install monitoring agent and collectors |
| benchmarks | Install various benchmarks (OSU/NCCL/Stream) |
| networkdevicenames | Install udev rules for correct device naming |

build_groups
: Defines component versions and variables
default = [ "kernel_parameters", "oci_hpc_packages", "mofed_54_3681", "hpcx_2131", "openmpi_414", "nvidia_515", "nvidia_cuda_11_7" ]
